    <span class="font-weight-bolder">1. Closing a Company </span>

    <p class="text-sm pt-3">
        Directors might consider closing a company due to certain reasons, some positive and some
        unfortunate. It is not an easy decision to take often, yet relevant for its intended purpose. Closing a
        company is too daunting as it requires so much paper work. Our job is easy, and it is to make sure
        that your wish really does become our command!

    <p class="text-sm pt-3">
        Company Liquidation means closing down a company in the process of selling all the available
        assets. The main purpose of liquidation often is to sell the assets so the business pays back its debts.
        It’s a process we are happy to assist with.

    <p class="text-sm pt-3">
        Restoration means revoking the status of a closed company, and refurbishing it. Well, at least that’s
        as simple as it sounds; but all the work is our duty!
